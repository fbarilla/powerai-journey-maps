Welcome to the Welcome to the free trial of PowerAI frameworks on the cloud. 
The container is already provisioned with PowerAI v1.4 with the following attributes: 32 thread POWER8, 128 GB, 1 x P100 Tesla GPU with NVLink (np8g1)
The container contains several cognitive journeys that demonstrate the use of deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or Caffe in extracting or recognizing patterns from large amounts of data. While the Jupyter notebooks can run without GPUs, having the P100 Tesla GPU along with IBM's NVLink technology adds significant acceleration, specially for large datasets and for use cases involving data transfers between CPU and GPU. 
Please note that there is a built in 4 hour timer to save resources and free up the GPU in case it is not being used. This timer starts at time of creation and is not affected by the login or logout by the user. Upon the 4 hour mark, the container will shut itself down, free the GPU and the container will be deleted. However, any files that the user kept in the containerâ€™s /shared directory will be preserved and the user can log back in with new credentials assigned after the user presses "restart" from the IBM Marketplace dashboard, as long as there is left over clock time.
