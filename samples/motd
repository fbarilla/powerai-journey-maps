All ML/DL frameworks live in /opt/DL; you must source an environment setup
script before accessing them, e.g. one of the following:

	source /opt/DL/caffe-bvlc/bin/caffe-activate
	source /opt/DL/caffe-ibm/bin/caffe-activate
	source /opt/DL/caffe-nv/bin/caffe-activate	# recommended
	source /opt/DL/chainer/bin/chainer-activate
	source /opt/DL/openblas/bin/openblas-activate
	source /opt/DL/tensorflow/bin/tensorflow-activate
	source /opt/DL/theano/bin/theano-activate
	source /opt/DL/torch/bin/torch-activate

After sourcing the environment script for the framework you wish to use,
please read the framework-specific documentation in its respective doc[s]
directory - e.g. one of the following:

	/opt/DL/caffe-*/docs
	/opt/DL/chainer/doc
	/opt/DL/openblas/doc
	/opt/DL/repo/doc
	/opt/DL/tensorflow/doc
	/opt/DL/theano/doc
	/opt/DL/torch/doc
