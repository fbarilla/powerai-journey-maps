# TensorFlow Journey Maps

## TensorFlow Machine Learning with Financial, New York Times and Watson Data on IBM Power 8 systems
This solution presents an accessible, non-trivial example of machine learning with time series on IBM Power8 systems. This experiment will focus on the ‘renewable energy’ sector. In this solution, we will: 
Obtain ‘renewable energy’ data from a number of financial markets (indexes and ETFs).
Obtain from the New York Times articles related to renewable energies
Use Watson to process the articles and extract meaningful data.
Munge that data into a usable format and perform exploratory data analysis in order to explore and validate a premise.
Use TensorFlow to build, train and evaluate a number of models for predicting what will happen in financial markets 

## Use transfer learning to create your own image classifier with a Jupyter Notebook
This journey was built for developers looking to leverage the new PowerAI offering from IBM. We will use a Jupyter Notebook to showcase an example of transfer learning with the TensorFlow Inception model on IBM POWER8® systems. The notebook will focus on creating a custom classifier to recognize houses with pools vs. houses without pools from JPEG images.
Significance of the program: Demonstrate the versatility of the PowerAI product for application developers who need to efficiently build powerful deep-learning applications, but may not have an abundance of time or data science experience.

## Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) – SETI Signal Classification on PowerAI with Multi GPU
Each night, using the Allen Telescope Array (ATA) in northern California, the SETI Institute scans the sky at various radio frequencies, observing star systems with known exoplanets, searching for faint but persistent signals. Framing the radio signal data into spectrogram (a 2D visual representation), we can convert the problem into something akin to an image classification problem. Therefore we can run Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), will be run on the images which are the result of converting the signals to spectrogram.
